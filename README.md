# ILC(Internal Linear Combination)
Nonparametric component separation for Cosmic Microwave Background observations in harmonic space


# Description
ILC(Internal Linear Combination) is the foreground removal method.
You can subtract foreground and noise from observation imaps using this method, and get clean CMB map.
You should note that this method is perforemed in harmonic space. For detail, see thesis 'A high resolution foreground cleaned CMB map from WMAP'(Max Tegmark, Ang ÃÅelica de Oliveira-Costa et al, arXiv.org)
